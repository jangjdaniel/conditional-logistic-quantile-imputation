# This is the first thing that should be run for this simulation study
# Here we load all the necessary packages and define all the necessary functions
# This will keep everything clean and organized, and that's what we want, right?

# Here are the packages that we need for R (our) life. Very useful things!
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(MASS)
library(purrr) #for looping
library(tictoc) #for checking runtime
library(LaplacesDemon)

# Here are some specialized packages for ease of life to extract visualizations from our simulations
library(gt)
library(gtsummary)
library(broom)

# Here are the packages we need for specific methods:
library(quantreg) #for logistic quantile regression
library(missMethods) #general missing methods
library(mice) #for PMM

# Specialized package to speed up calculations... may or may not use
library(Rcpp) #future implementation for faster calculations in CLQI
