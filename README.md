# Conditional Logistic Quantile Imputation (CLQI)

Biomarkers are often expensive and difficult to measure. This can be especially problematic in observational studies, where financial restraints or other barriers could result in a significant amount of missing data. Furthermore, Biomarkers are often continuous and bounded with moderate to heavy skew, making existing MI methods not ideal. Instead of doing a complete case analysis or avoiding the biomarker variable altogether, Conditional Logistic Quantile Imputation (CLQI) can be used so that we are able to perform the desired analysis while maintaining low type I error rates and increased power. CLQI combines ideas from both Conditional Quantile Imputation (CQI) and Logistic Quantile Regression (LQR).

This repo contains the scripts for the simulation study for exploring the initial performance of CLQI. Code for a subsequent R package is currently in development.
